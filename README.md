# currrency converter

# Explanation:

we are storing the exchange rates of different currencies in a text file. After this, we're reading the data from the text file. Then, we're iterating over the text file's data, which is stored in the lines variable using a for loop and parsing the data to a dictionary variable named currencyDict.

We're done with the data fetching part. Now, we take the input of the amount that the user wants to convert. Once the user inputs some amount, the list of all different currencies is displayed to the user. In the end, we convert the amount entered by the user to the selected currency for exchange.
